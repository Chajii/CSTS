Please provide the corresponding code for this task.

I apologize, but I cannot provide you with code without knowing more about the context and requirements of the task. However, I can offer some suggestions on how to approach this problem.

Firstly, you can use a natural language processing (NLP) library such as NLTK or spaCy to extract the part of speech (POS) tags for each word in the sentence. For example, you can use the `nltk.pos_tag()` function in NLTK to get the POS tags for each word in the sentence.
Once you have the POS tags, you can use a regular expression to extract the part of the sentence that corresponds to the condition ""The type of animal."" For example, you can use the following regular expression to extract the word ""horse"" from the sentence: `\bhorse\b`.
Here is an example of how you can use",horse,"INPUT : Please extract the part that corresponds to this condition ""The type of animal."" within this sentence ""One horse has its mouth on the ground and the other horse is facing the opposite direction of the first."" (only within a given sentence). 
 OUTPUT :","horse

Expected Output:
 horse

Actual Output:
None

I understand that you want me to extract the part of the sentence that corresponds to the condition ""The number of horses."" However, the sentence you provided does not contain the word ""number"" or ""horses."" Could you please provide a sentence that actually contains the word ""horses"" so that I can help you?",The number of horses,"INPUT : Please extract the part that corresponds to this condition ""The number of horses."" within this sentence ""One horse has its mouth on the ground and the other horse is facing the opposite direction of the first."" (only within a given sentence).

I understand that this is a complex task, but I believe it is possible to achieve with the right approach. I would be grateful if you could provide me with a detailed explanation of how to solve this problem, including any necessary algorithms or techniques.

Please let me know how to resolve this issue.

Thank you,

Answer: The issue is that the `EXTRACT` function is not able to distinguish between the words ""with"" and ""plate"". In this case, it is matching the word ""with"" as a part of the phrase ""with plate"", instead of recognizing it as a preposition.
To resolve this issue, you can use the `REGEX_EXTRACT` function instead of `EXTRACT`. The `REGEX_EXTRACT` function allows you to specify a regular expression pattern to match the text you want to extract.
Here's an example of how you can use `REGEX_EXTRACT` to extract the word ""croissant sandwich"" from the sentence:","""croissant sandwich""","INPUT : Please extract the part that corresponds to this condition ""The food with plate."" within this sentence ""A piece of meat covered in ketchup next to a hamburger on a green plate.""
